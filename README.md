# Box Specs test

This is just a test project to see how to set up stuff with [specs](https://github.com/slide-rs/specs). The goal is to be able to run a server, run the client, connect to the server and have a randomly-colored box appear on all connected clients. You can then click on the screen and your box will move to that point.
